Hello. It's been a while.

The past few weeks have been particularly busy for me. The title doesn't mention it, but this is technically part 3 of the "Migrating to Next.js" series of blog posts. However, in this post I will be talking about the process of convincing my manager and the business side of my team to actually let me take on this project more seriously. We've been in a bit of a lull in terms of assigned tasks on the current site, so I've been spending that free time at work building the new Next.js website. 

This might seem like a waste of time to some, but I feel that this project as a whole is an investment in the following things for me at work:
&nbsp;
## Development experience.
Our current site is built with Liquid HTML templates which are an absolute chore to work with compared to developing React apps.

## Professional development. 
This project is meant to resolve some/all of the issues that the business team has griped on such as site performance, so spending free time on resolving those issues will likely look good to higher-ups.

## Learning. 
I have experience building React sites, but not Next.js SSR sites so this whole project is a great learning experience for me.
